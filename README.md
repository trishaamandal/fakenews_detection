# Fake News Detection

## What is Fake News?

Fake news is a type of yellow journalism that includes news pieces which may be hoaxes and are generally spread through social media and other online platforms. These news items are often created to further or impose certain ideas, typically with political agendas. Fake news can contain false or exaggerated claims and may become viral through algorithms and user interactions, leading to filter bubbles where users are only exposed to information that reinforces their existing beliefs.

## What is a TfidfVectorizer?

The `TfidfVectorizer` is a tool used in text processing to convert a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features. 

- **TF (Term Frequency):** This is the number of times a word appears in a document. Higher values indicate that the term appears more frequently in the document, suggesting it is a good match for search terms.

- **IDF (Inverse Document Frequency):** This measures how significant a term is across a collection of documents. Terms that appear frequently in many documents might be less significant. IDF helps identify words that are more important in the context of the entire corpus.

The `TfidfVectorizer` combines these metrics to transform text data into numerical features, which can then be used for various machine learning algorithms and text analysis.
